- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

- All 16/16 items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- 3 clarifications applied (2026-03-31): dual progress mechanism, stub-only consumers, habit-based progress formula.
- Kafka topic names in acceptance scenarios are domain terminology, not implementation leakage.
- "Soft-delete" and "database cascade" in edge cases describe data behavior patterns, not specific technologies.
